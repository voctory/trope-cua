/// Mouse synthesis via `NSEvent.mouseEvent(...).cgEvent`, posted
/// through SkyLight's per-pid event-post path AND the system HID
/// event tap (the two are complementary — SkyLight reaches a
/// backgrounded target's mach port, HID tap delivers to the
/// frontmost app the normal way).
///
/// Architectural note: the driver is AX-only for mouse wherever an
/// AX path exists — left-click and show-menu on an AX-addressable
/// element dispatch via `AXUIElementPerformAction` against a cached
/// element handle. The coordinate-addressed paths here are the
/// deliberate carve-out: some surfaces (web content, native canvases,
/// games) don't expose an AX-responsive element, so the only
/// remaining option is synthesized `mouseDown` / `mouseUp` pairs at a
/// pixel. For AX-addressable elements the element_index path is
/// strictly better — it's pure RPC and works on backgrounded /
/// hidden windows.
///
/// Why NSEvent-bridge (was: raw CGEvent): AppKit-style construction
/// via `+[NSEvent mouseEventWithType:location:...
/// windowNumber:context:eventNumber:clickCount:pressure:]` bridged to
/// CGEvent via `-[NSEvent CGEvent]` produces events that Chromium's
/// renderer accepts as trusted — raw-CGEvent-built events are
/// silently filtered at the renderer IPC boundary. Switching to the
/// NSEvent-bridged path fixed Chromium web-content hit-tests on
/// backgrounded targets.
///
/// Coordinate convention: `NSEvent.mouseEvent(location:)` expects
/// AppKit / Cocoa coordinates — screen-bottom-left origin, y-up.
/// Our public API takes the `CGPoint` / screen-point convention used
/// everywhere else in the driver (screen-top-left origin, y-down).
/// We flip y against the main screen's height before handing to
/// `NSEvent.mouseEvent`; the `.cgEvent` bridge then re-flips back to
/// the Quartz top-left convention when emitting the `CGEvent` — so
/// the posted event ends up at the original screen-point the caller
/// asked for. Verified by comparing `CGEvent.location` before and
/// after the bridge against a raw-CGEvent-built event at the same
/// point.
///
/// WindowNumber: we pass 0 ("not associated with any window") rather
/// than the result of a `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` hit-test.
/// Empirically, passing a non-zero `windowNumber` causes the
/// resulting event to be rejected by the HID-tap dispatcher even
/// when the window genuinely owns the click point. The event still
/// carries its screen-space location, so WindowServer's own
/// hit-test picks up the right target on post.
///
/// Post paths, in order of preference:
///
///   1. `SkyLightEventPost.postToPid` (auth-signed). Reaches a
///      backgrounded target's queue directly, no cursor movement.
///      Works cleanly for keyboard; for mouse it delivers to
///      Chromium-family targets but is unreliable against ordinary
///      AppKit targets.
///   2. `CGEvent.postToPid(pid)` (public API). Delivers to the pid's
///      mach port directly. Does NOT move the real cursor, does NOT
///      activate the target. A separate code path from SkyLight's,
///      often lands where SkyLight silently drops for AppKit mouse.
///
/// We fire (1) and (2) in sequence and accept the cost of each event
/// possibly arriving at the target twice — neither path moves the
/// user's real cursor, so the only observable cost is extra mach
/// traffic. We deliberately do NOT fall back to `.cghidEventTap`:
/// the HID tap routes through WindowServer with the real cursor,
/// which warps the user's pointer to the click point. That's a
/// focus-steal-equivalent behavior we reject — pixel click's whole
/// value is it's invisible to the user.
///
/// `count` and `modifiers` support:
/// - `count: 2` synthesizes a double-click (two down/up pairs ~80ms
///   apart, with each pair's `clickCount` set to the click index so
///   AppKit / Chromium coalesce them into a double-click).
/// - `modifiers` maps the same `cmd/shift/option/ctrl/fn` vocabulary
///   as `KeyboardInput` onto the event's flags, enabling ctrl-click
///   and cmd-click from the pixel path.
///
/// Known limitation: pixel-addressed right-click into Chromium *web
/// content* is observed to land as a left-click — the event reaches
/// the renderer, but Chromium's web-content hit-test appears to coerce
/// the button back to primary for pointer events that weren't
/// originated by the real HID. Observed in every non-HID-tap recipe
/// we've tried. For context menus on AX-addressable elements (browser
/// chrome, links, buttons that advertise `AXShowMenu`), the
/// `element_index` path remains the reliable option.
