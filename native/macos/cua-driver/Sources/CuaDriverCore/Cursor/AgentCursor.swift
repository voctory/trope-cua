///
/// The overlay is lazy — the window + view are created on first

/// orders the window off-screen but doesn't tear down the view tree;
/// the next `show()` is effectively instant.

/// ## Threading
///
/// Everything here is `@MainActor`-isolated because AppKit requires it.
/// Call from a `Task { @MainActor in … }` block if you're coming from
/// an async non-main context.
///
/// ## Run-loop prerequisite
///
/// AppKit drawing + CA animations need a live main-thread run loop
/// pumping events. The driver's default stdio-MCP entry point does NOT
/// currently bootstrap `NSApplication.shared.run()` — wire-up for that
/// lives outside this module (a later commit). Until that wire-up is
/// in place, `show()` still succeeds but the cursor won't draw or
/// animate. That's fine for the first commit: the types compile and
/// unit tests can exercise the math without a running screen.
